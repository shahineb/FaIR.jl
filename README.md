# fair.jl


[x] Clean up ebm (make the forward methods compact like for the other modules)
[x] Change dirty constructors to clean constructing functions
[x] Implement more sophisticated forcing function that allows to load the actual file
[ ] Methane lifetime update -> might mean I need to think of a way to distinguish species in alpha
[ ] Handling of aerosols
[ ] Implement aerosol forcing computation (directly from emissions)
[ ] Allow to use prescribed forcing for Volcanic activity
[ ] Make it possible to load multiple configs (not too hard, only applies to ebm)
[ ] Start documenting code
[x] Harmonise modules, struct, function naming
[ ] Add an option to sample multiple trajectories from internal variability
[ ] Sampling from parameters?
[ ] Tuning against parameters?
